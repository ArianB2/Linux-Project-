# Linux-Project-
A simple weather data package provided by the open source project wttr.in, a web service that provides weather forecast information in a simple and text-based format. For further information, you can read more about the service on its GitHub Repo.

First, you'll use the curl command to scrape weather data via the wttr.in website. For example, to get data for Casablanca, enter:

# 1. curl wttr.in/Tirane
which prints the following to stdout
# 2. Create a new terminal and enter in 'curl wttr.in/Tirane which shall show you the City's weather as well as wind speed.
